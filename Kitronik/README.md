# Kitronik Lamp and Access Gate Project

Welcome to the **Kitronik Lamp and Access Gate Project**! This project utilizes the **Kitronik Inventor's Kit** to create and control a lamp and an access gate with microcontrollers.

## Overview

The Kitronik Lamp and Access Gate are versatile and educational tools for learning about electronics and programming. In this project, we explore how to:

- Assemble the Kitronik Lamp and Access Gate.
- Program the lamp and gate using microcontrollers.
- Access and control their features.

## Features

- **Customizable Lighting**: Adjust brightness and colors for the lamp.
- **Access Control**: Program and operate the access gate for secure entry.
- **Microcontroller Integration**: Program behaviors using platforms like Arduino or Micro:bit.
- **Educational Focus**: Learn about circuits and coding.

## Getting Started

1. **Assemble the Lamp and Access Gate**: Follow the Kitronik assembly guides.
2. **Connect the Microcontroller**: Ensure proper wiring and connections for both devices.
3. **Access the Devices**: Use the provided code examples to control the lamp and gate.
