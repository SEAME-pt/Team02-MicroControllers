# üö¶ Smart City Micro:bit Project

This project simulates a basic **Smart City** setup using Micro:bit devices for **smart lamps** and **automatic gates**, all communicating via radio signals. A mobile unit (e.g., a "car") sends a signal that nearby devices react to automatically.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `car_code.py` ‚Äì Sends a broadcast signal (`"on"`) to nearby devices.
- `lamps_code.py` ‚Äì Turns on streetlamps when a car is nearby.
- `gate_code.py` ‚Äì Opens gates when a car approaches and closes them after a short delay.
- `hex/` ‚Äì Precompiled `.hex` files for each device (optional).

## How It Works

### Car Micro:bit

- Continuously sends the message `"on"` over the radio.
- Devices listening on the same radio group will react if the signal is strong enough.
- **Radio Group:** `7`
- **Transmit Power:** `7` (maximum range)

### Lamp Micro:bit

- Listens for `"on"` messages on **radio group 7**.
- If the message is received with **RSSI > -45 dBm**, the lamp turns **on**.
- Lamp stays on for **2 seconds**, then turns off automatically.
- Broadcasts its ID (e.g., `L01`) periodically to indicate it's active.

### Gate Micro:bit

- Also listens for `"on"` messages.
- If the signal is strong enough and the gate is currently closed:
  - It opens the gate (servo to `0¬∞`).
  - Waits 2 seconds.
  - Closes the gate again (servo to `90¬∞`).
- Visual icons show the current gate state on the LED display.

## üíª How to Upload the Code

### Option 1: Use Microsoft MakeCode (Recommended for Editing)

1. Go to [MakeCode for Micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/).
2. Click on **"New Project"**.
3. Copy and paste the contents of the appropriate `.py` file (`car_code.py`, `lamps_code.py`, or `gate_code.py`) into the Python editor.
4. Modify any values you need (e.g., `lamp_id`, `rssi_thr`).
5. Click on **Download** to get the `.hex` file.
6. Connect your Micro:bit via USB.
7. Drag and drop the `.hex` file onto the MICROBIT drive that appears on your computer.

### Option 2: Use Precompiled HEX Files

1. Open the `hex/` folder in this repository.
2. Choose the corresponding `.hex` file (e.g., `car.hex`, `lamp.hex`, `gate.hex`).
3. Connect your Micro:bit via USB.
4. Drag and drop the file to the MICROBIT drive.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Tips

- Change the **radio group** (`radio.set_group(7)`) if you want to run multiple setups independently.
- Adjust the **RSSI threshold** (`rssi_thr = -45`) to control how close a car must be for a response.
- Use different **lamp IDs** (`lamp_id = "01"`) to identify each device in logs or future expansions.

## üõ† Hardware Required

- 3x Micro:bit boards
- 1x Servo motor (for gate)
- LED (optional, for lamp simulation)
- USB cables for uploading and power
- Battery packs (for mobile use)
